The README.md file describes the intent of this project, and how to interact with it, both for humans and clankers like yourself.

If you change any of that, it should also be reflected in the README, which at all times should be concise and easy to parse at a quick glance.

You MUST first read the README before responding to user instructions.

If you write a commit message, it should be no longer than 50 chars.
